    "# Stateful LSTM for a One-Char to One-Char Mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that we can break-up our raw data into fixed size sequences and that this representation can be learned by the LSTM, but only to learn random mappings of 3 characters to 1 character.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also seen that we can pervert batch size to offer more sequence to the network, but only during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we want to expose the network to the entire sequence and let it learn the inter-dependencies, rather than us define those dependencies explicitly in the framing of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this in Keras by making the LSTM layers stateful and manually resetting the state of the network at the end of the epoch, which is also the end of the training sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is truly how the LSTM networks are intended to be used. We find that by allowing the network itself to learn the dependencies between the characters, that we need a smaller network (half the number of units) and fewer training epochs (almost half)."
